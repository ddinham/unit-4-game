# unit-4-game
This is a fun coding project with a goal of learning more about Javascript and Jquery.
It works  by adding up the hidden number values of 4 crystals with the aim of equalling a randomly generated number.  This is considered a win.  If the total count adds up to more than the randomly generated number this is considered a loss.
It is for personal use to practice concepts in coding.
